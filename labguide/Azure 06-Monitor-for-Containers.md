It delivers a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments.

A few examples of what you can do with Azure Monitor include:

- Detect and diagnose issues across applications and dependencies with Application Insights.
- Correlate infrastructure issues with VM insights and Container insights.
- Collect data from monitored resources by using Azure Monitor Metrics.
