## Exercise 4: Scale the application and validate HA

**Duration**: 40 minutes

## Overview

At this point, you have deployed a single instance of the Web and Products API service containers. In this exercise, you will increase the number of container instances for the web service and scale the front end in the existing cluster.

### Task 1: Modify the Kubernetes resource deployments in the Kubernetes service

In this task, you will increase the number of instances for the API deployment in the AKS. While it is deploying, you will observe the changing status.

1. Navigate to Azure portal, open **contoso-traders-aks<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** Kubernetes service from **ContosoTraders-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** resource group. Select **Workloads** under Kubernetes resources from the left side menu and then select the **contoso-traders-products** deployment.

   ![In the edit YAML dialog, 2 is entered in the desired number of replicas.](media/HA1.png "Setting replicas to 2")

1. Select **YAML** from the left menu in the **contoso-traders-products** Overview and scroll down until you find **replicas** under **spec** section. Change the number of replicas to **2**, and then select **Review + save**. When prompted, check **Confirm manifest change** and select **Save**.

   ![In the edit YAML dialog, 2 is entered in the desired number of replicas.](media/3..2.png "Setting replicas to 2")

    >**Note**: If the deployment completes quickly, you may not see the deployment in waiting states in the portal, as described in the following steps.

1. It is currently deploying, and you can see that there is one healthy instance and one awaiting instance.

1. Open the Contoso Traders web application, and you can see that the application should still work without errors.

    ![Replica Sets is selected under Workloads in the navigation menu on the left, and at right, Pods status: 1 pending, 1 running is highlighted. Below that, a red arrow points at the API deployment in the Pods box.](media/website3.png "View replica details")

### Task 2: Resolve failed replica provisioningÂ 

In this task, you will resolve the failed API replicas. These failures occur due to the clusters'inability to meet the requested resources.

1. In the **contoso-traders-aks<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** Kubernetes service, select **Workloads** and then select the **contoso-traders-products** deployment. 

   ![In the Workload view with the API deployment highlighted.](media/rgdn1.1.jpg "API deployment is now healthy")

1. Select the **YAML** from the left menu in the **contoso-traders-products** Overview.

   ![In the Workload view with the API deployment highlighted.](media/CNA-Ex4-task2-step2.png "API deployment is now healthy")

1. In the **YAML** screen scroll down and change the following items:

   - Under the **spec** section add the following **ports**.

      ```yaml
      ports:
        - containerPort: 3001
          protocol: TCP
      ```

   - Modify the **cpu** and set it to **100m**. CPU is divided between all Pods on a Node.

      ```yaml
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 128Mi
      ```

   Select **Review + save**, and when prompted to confirm the changes, select **Save**.

   ![In the edit YAML dialog, showing two changes required.](media/3..3.png "Modify deployment manifest")

1. Return to the **Workloads** main view of the **contoso-traders-aks<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** Kubernetes service and you will now see that the Deployment is healthy with two Pods operating.

   ![In the Workload view with the API deployment highlighted.](media/HS3.png "API deployment is now healthy")       

### Task 3: Configure Horizontal Autoscaling for Kubernetes service pods

In this task, you will be configuring the Horizontal Autoscaling for your Kubernetes service pods.
   
1. Navigate back to your Windows command prompt.

1. Run the below command to configure the Horizontal autoscaling for your API Products pods.

   ```bash 
   kubectl autoscale deployment contoso-traders-products -n contoso-traders --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10
   ```
   
   ![In the Workload view with the API deployment highlighted.](media/HS11.png "API deployment is now healthy")
   
1. Run the below command to check the status of the newly added Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.

   ```
   kubectl get hpa -n contoso-traders
   ```
   
   ![In the Workload view with the API deployment highlighted.](media/HS12.png "API deployment is now healthy")

### Task 4: Autoscaling on Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

In this task, you will be enabling the cluster autoscaler for the existing AKS cluster and you will be autoscaling the cluster node pools.

1. Navigate back to your Windows command prompt. If you are not logged into Azure, log in to azure with the below command after updating the values in the below command.

   * Username: **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>**
   * Password: **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>**

    ```
    az login -u [username] -p [Password]
    ```

1. In order to set up the Kubernetes cluster connection, make sure to replace the SUFFIX with the given DeploymentID **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="true"/>** value in the below command.

    ```
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group ContosoTraders-SUFFIX --name contoso-traders-aksSUFFIX
    ```
    
1.  Verify the `count` of node pools in the cluster and ensure that `enablingAutoScaling` is `null`. Make sure to replace the SUFFIX with the given DeploymentID **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="true"/>** value in the below command.   
    
     ```
     az aks nodepool list --resource-group ContosoTraders-SUFFIX --cluster-name contoso-traders-aksSUFFIX
     ```   
    
    ![](media/ex4-t3-scaling1.png)

1. Run the below command to enable the cluster autoscale in the existing cluster. Verify that `enablingAutoScaling` is `true`.  Make sure to replace the SUFFIX with the given DeploymentID **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="true"/>** value in the below command.

    ```
    az aks update --resource-group ContosoTraders-SUFFIX --name contoso-traders-aksSUFFIX --enable-cluster-autoscaler --min-count 1 --max-count 3
    ```
  
   ![](media/ex4-t3-scaling2.png)
   
    >**Note**: Please be aware that the above command may take up to 5 minutes to finish the updation. Before taking any further action, make sure it ran successfully.

4. Under the `contentdb` database, expand **Items** collection, select **Scale & Settings**.

    ![](media/scaleitem.png "View replica details")

5. On the **Scale**, select **Autoscale** for the **Throughput** setting under **Scale** and click on **Save**.

    ![The screenshot displays Cosmos DB Scale and Settings tab with Autoscale selected](media/ex4-autodbscale.png "CosmosDB collection scale and settings")

### Task 7: Test CosmosDB Autoscale

In this task, you will run a performance test script that will test the Autoscale feature of Azure Cosmos DB so you can see that it will now scale greater than 400 RU/s.

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the **contosotraders-<inject key="DeploymentID" />** Azure Cosmos DB Account.

2. Select **Connection String** under **Settings**.

   ![](media/cnctionstring1.png "View replica details")

3. On the **Connection String** pane, copy the **HOST**, **USERNAME**, and **PRIMARY PASSWORD** values. Save these in textfile for later use.

    ![The Cosmos DB account Connection String pane with the fields to copy highlighted.](media/cnctionstringnew.png "View CosmosDB connection string")

4. Open the Command prompt, and connect to the build agent VM using the given command **<inject key="Command to Connect to Build Agent VM" enableCopy="true" />**.

5. When asked for the password, enter **Build Agent VM Password** given below.

   * Password: **<inject key="Build Agent VM Password" enableCopy="true" />**

6. On the **Build agent VM**, navigate to the `~/lab-files` directory.

    ```bash
    cd Cloud-Native-Application/labfiles/src
    ```

7. Run the following command to open the `perftest.sh` script in editor window.

    ```bash
    sudo chmod 777 perftest.sh
    vi perftest.sh
    ```

8. There are several variables declared at the top of the `perftest.sh` script. Press **_i_** to get into `insert` mode. Then modify the **host**, **username**, and **password** variables by setting their values to the corresponding Cosmos DB Connection String values that were copied previously.

    ![The screenshot shows Vim with perftest.sh file open and variables set to Cosmos DB Connection String values.](media/updatepreftest.png "Modify the connection information in Vim")

9. Then press **_ESC_**, write **_:wq_** to save your changes and close the file.
    
    >**Note**: If **_ESC_** doesn't work press `ctrl+[` and then write **_:wq_** to save your changes and close the file.
    
10. Run the following command to execute the `perftest.sh` script to run a small load test against CosmosDB. This script will consume RUs in CosmosDB by inserting many documents into the Sessions container.

    ```bash
    bash ./perftest.sh
    ```

    > **Note:** The script will take a few minutes to complete its execution.

11. Once the script execution is completed, navigate back to the **CosmosDB account** in the Azure portal.

12. Scroll down on the **Overview** pane of the **Cosmos DB account** blade and locate the **Request Charge** graph.

    > **Note:** It may take 2 - 5 minutes for the activity on the CosmosDB collection to appear in the activity log. Wait a couple of minutes and then refresh the page if the recent Request charge doesn't show up right now.

13. Notice that the **Request charge** now shows there was activity on the **CosmosDB account** that exceeded the 400 RU/s limit that was previously set before Autoscale was turned on.

    ![The screenshot shows the Cosmos DB request charge graph showing recent activity from performance test](media/cosmos-request-charge.png "Recent CosmosDB activity graph")
    
    >**Note**: In case you don't see data on the graph, please set the time range to last 1 hour.

14. Click the **Next** button located in the bottom right corner of this lab guide to continue with the next exercise.

## Summary

In this exercise, you have increased service instances and configured horizontal autoscaling for AKS pods. Also, you have configured and tested CosmosDB Autoscale.
